# Code for Ranek et al., QUICHE reveals structural definitions of anti-tumor responses in triple-negative breast cancer

## Introduction
QUICHE is a statistical differential abundance testing method that can be used to discover cellular niches differentially enriched in spatial regions, longitudinal samples, or clinical patient groups. If you'd like to perform spatial enrichment analysis using QUICHE, please see the associated repo: https://github.com/jranek/quiche. Alternatively, if you'd like to reproduce the analysis from the paper, please see below.

## Data access
You can download all of the preprocessed MIBI-TOF datasets (`.h5ad` files) from the [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14290163) repository. Imaging data and cell segmentation masks can be found in the [BioStudies](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD1507) repository.
