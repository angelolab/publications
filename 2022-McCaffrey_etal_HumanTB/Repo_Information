This repository contains custom Matlab and R scripts used in McCaffrey et al. A script key can be found in the main directory that lists each script, the required dependencies, a description of what the script does, lists output (if any), and indicates where in the figures each script was used. Each programming language directory contains a 'data' folder with all the necessary data to execute each script.
